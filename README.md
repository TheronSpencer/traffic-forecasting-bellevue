# Forecasting Traffic Flow in Bellevue, Washington

The traffic flow at a location on Interstate-90, one-half of a mile east of the Interstate-405 junction, is modelled in this paper. Four different time series models are implemented: SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), TBATS (Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components), DHR (Dynamic Harmonic Regression). The data was gathered by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) using a permanent traffic recorder (site ID: S203, https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Traffic/API/PermanentTrafficRecorder/?siteId=S203&startYear=2007&endYear=2019&startMonth=1&endMonth=8&tables=TrafficSpeedByHour).
